/* on Linux compile  with `cc -shared xtable.c -o xtable.so` */

/* on Windows, define the symbols 'LUA_BUILD_AS_DLL' and 'LUA_LIB' and
 * compile and link with stub library lua52.lib (for lua52.dll)
 * generating xtable.dll. If necessary, generate lua52.lib and lua52.dll by 
 * compiling Lua sources with 'LUA_BUILD_AS_DLL' defined.
*/

/* To test, run `lua test-xtable.lua`. The results should be the same as
 * in the file `test-xtable.out`.
