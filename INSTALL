Installation from LuaRocks
--------------------------

    luarocks install xtable
    luarocks install ihelp    (optional)

To test, go to the `doc` directory and run `lua -l xtable test-xtable.lua`. 
The results should be the same as in `test-xtable.out`.

Full documentation in `xtable-manual.html` and `sample.html`.   

Manual installation (for developers and maintainers)
----------------------------------------------------

In the top level directory of the package,

    make

If this does not work, you are on your own. Maybe the terse hints 
in Makefile and src/Makefile will help.
